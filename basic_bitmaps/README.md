# Basic Bitmaps in PyQt5

Note, the following exercises should mostly be complete in class, but
they form a part of your homework to be due next week.

## Exercise 0

Run the `a_simple_line.py` application.

  1. Why use the `QLabel` widget?
  2. What is a `QPixmap`?

## Exercise 1 

  3. Review the `ModernDarkStyle` in the [norwegianwood repo](https://github.com/me701/norwegianwood)
     and tweak/apply to your line application.  (I wasn't going to include QSS, but I spent a lot 
     of time making the darn example work, so I'd like to show you how easy the QSS part actually is!)

## Exercise 2

  4. Now, look up how to load an existing image into `QPixmap` and 
     load the map.  You may need to adjust the canvas size to accomodate 
     the image.
  5. Draw a red line from the "start" to the "end"

## Exercise 2

  6. Add a title to the bitmap.

## Exercise 3

  7. Modify your existing code so that instead of a pre-defined route, you 
     can draw the route using the cursor.

## Exercise 4 

  8. Contemplate the potential for this sort of bitmap generation to be part 
     of the fridge optimization procedure you just completed for project 1.
     Then, summarize your thoughts.
